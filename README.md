# FlytBase Drone Control Demo

This repository contains two demo applications for controlling a drone using FlytBase's documentation. Each application demonstrates a different flight pattern.

## Task 1: Square Trajectory

### Description
Create a demo app to make the drone takeoff at 5m, move in a square trajectory of side length 6.5m at a height of 5m, and land once the entire mission is over. This app is designed to work with the FlytSIM simulator.

### Instructions
To run this demo, follow these steps:

1. [Install FlytSIM]() https://docs.flytbase.com/ : Follow the FlytSIM installation guide to set up the simulator environment.


## Task 2: Triangle Trajectory

### Description
Create a demo app to make the drone takeoff at 10m, move in a triangle trajectory of side length 10m at a height of 10m, and land once the entire mission is over. This app is designed to work with the FlytSIM simulator.

### Instructions
